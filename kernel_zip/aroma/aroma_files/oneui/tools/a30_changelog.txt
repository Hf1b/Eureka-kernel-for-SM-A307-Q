                        GLITCH OBSERVED WITH KERNEL

When phone is just booted, little cores cannot be overclocked above 1482 MHz when changed in a kernel manager.
Change governor for litte cluster to "userspace" and then change both max and min freq
to 1690 MHz.

                        MAIN FEATURES OF REV 3.8

1) Disabled Samsung security features (E.g: defex, dm verity, rooting restrictions, knox ncmâ€¦)

2) Disabled CRC check on data blocks which improves performance and also enabled toggleable CRC check feature.

3) Removed dirty status from scripts for github.

4) Enabled all governors except Schedutils governor.

5) Overclocked CPU as follows:
	BIG Cores: from 1768 MHz to 2288 MHz.
	LIL Cores: from 1560 MHz to 1690 MHz.

6) Removed a bunch of debugging and logging codes

7) Added GPU thermal and voltage control

8) Added latest boeffla_wl_blocker V 1.1.0 and disabled some wakelocks.

9) Some optimisations for overall performance in kernel

10) Balance battery and performance by reducing CPU wake-ups

11) Added NEON accelerated XOR implementation which improves performance by about 20%

12) Use neon-vfpv4 and softfp

13) Enabled support for NTFS filesystems.

14) Use TCP Congestion algorithm instead of BIC (network speed improvement)

15) Added battery control 

16) Optimized cpufreq and interactive governor.

17) Use -O3 optimization for inputs and crypto

18) Defined new cpumasks for big and little clusters (will be used by future commits)

19) GPU max frequency overclocked from 845 MHz to 1300 MHz

20) Underclocked CPU as follows:
	BIG Cores: from 936 MHz to 520 MHz.
	LIL Cores: from 839 MHz to 449 MHz.
	
21) Optimised gpu codes

22) Disabled more securities which could result in bootloop.

23) Enable zram support and set default compressor as lz4.

24) Reduced transition latency for cpu frequencies.

25) Removed verify flag from dt.

26) Undervolt gpu and cpu by 100 mV (Experimental, probably not working).

27) Switch to a lower charging voltage more quickly. This results in a slight reduce in battery capacity
(about 3% less usable capacity) but this helps to extend the cycle life of the battery.

28) Reviewed cpu overclock and underclock codes.

29) Adjusted default gpu highspeed frequency to 1001 MHz.

30) Overclock gpu max frequency to 1300 MHz (High battery drain and overheat).

31) Upstream LZ4 compressor module and other related optimisations.

32) Implemented Dynamic FSync 2.0

33) Enabled power efficient workqueue by default.

34) Reduce cpu frequency transition latency.


                       MAIN FEATURES OF R4.1

35) Upstreamed kernel version from 4.4.177 to 4.4.235 which is the latest stable version. Upstreaming allows kernel to have latest security updates, bug fixes, various code improvements and so on released by linux developpers.
	

                       MAIN FEATURES OF R4.3

36) Optimise kernel for performance instead of size

37) Built with Linaro V4.9.4 toolchain. Reason: Better performance

38) Other performance tweaks.. (developper Gabriel helped)

39) Enable deadline I/O scheduler (by developper Gabriel)


                        MAIN FEATURES OF R4.4.3
                 
40) Upstreamed kernel version from 4.4.235 to 4.4.238

41) Fixed CPU throttling of both clusters. All cores will get throttled only if temperature is above 95'C

42) Built with Linaro V6.5.0 toolchain

43) Mark some IRQs and Kthreads as performance critical

44) Patch SafetyNet to bypass detection (experimental)

45) Other performance tweaks

46) ...
